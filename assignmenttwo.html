  <h2> 
    Heuristic Review
  </h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Visibility of System Status: NO. Takes a very long time to load, and does not display any kind of loading indicator; makes you think you didn’t click or clicked on something that doesn’t work.
    </li>
    <li>
      Match with Real World: SOMEWHAT. For example, “Islandora Content Model” is not a meaningful way to filter for anyone who didn’t build the system. Separating Research Repository by school is useful, but should be integrated into filters rather than as a separate step.
    </li>
    <li>
      User Control & Freedom: YES. Four buttons to take users to main section are always displayed, and hyperlinked steps taken to get to a a page are displayed at the top of each page. Once viewing a resource, it is difficult to return to search.
    </li>
    <li>
      Consistency & Standards: YES. The website largely makes sense, though it takes too many steps to get anywhere.
    </li>
    <li>
      Error Prevention: Not relevant. If anything, User Control means navigation to last used page is fairly easy, but ridiculous loading times make fixing errors a lengthy process.
    </li>
    <li>
      Recognition vs. Recall: YES. Fields are labeled, headings are provided, it’s easy to know what you’re looking at and how you got there.
    </li>
    <li>
      Flexibility & Efficiency: NO. Pretty bare-bones. Although you can both search and browse, I suppose.
    </li>
    <li>
      Aesthetic & Minimalist Design: SOMEWHAT. Not a ton of extraneous stuff, but don’t need “Results per page” or “Islandora Collection/Content Model” or “Type” if there’s no alternative and not that many results.
    </li>
    <li>
      Error Help: NO. When search on "Search" page yielded no results, no further information or troubleshooting help was provided.
    </li>
    <li>
      Help & Documentation: NO. Nonexistent, and because the interface is a bit clumsy, would be useful, though better solution would be to improve interface.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2> 
    System Overview
  </h2>
  <p>
    This system's primary advantage is its navigability. Though not all steps are intuitive, users are almost always provided with a roadmap of where they are on the site and the steps they took to get there, hyperlinked, making it easy to backtrack if necessary. If users don't know what they are seeking, the given sections and headings provide useful information and context. They make clear what relevant subdivisions of information are for any of the topics presented on the site. As such, the information is very organized. There are many categories provided, none of which are empty or irrelevant to the topic at hand. However, some topics have far more categories than others, and those categories tend to be ones that would be more useful as filters, for instance date of publication.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unfortunately, the system's few strengths largely end there. Its primary, though least interesting, flaw is that each page takes an inordinately long time to load, and does not display any kind of visual cue to indicate that something is happening. This means that users are in the dark as to whether their action will yield an output, creating frustration and confusion. Another huge problem is that the search function on the "Search" page does not work. Inputting any term yields 0 results. A less determined user would certainly give up in that case, yielding the site useless for anyone who is looking for specific information rather than a browsing experience. Being a user with greater-than-average incentives to figure out the system, I discovered that the search function works perfectly well if used from the "Browse" page instead. The "Browse" page has its own set of issues, though; attempting to access actual documents takes far more steps than is desirable, particularly given that each action takes far too long to load. Many of the categories which needed to be independently navigated to would have been far more useful as filters or sort options. They would then be available from the first page, allowing users to quickly and efficiently seek out the required informtion.

  <h2> 
    Heuristic Review vs. Usability Test
  </h2>
  <p>
    Both I and my tester were deeply frustrated by the amount of time it took for each page to load. That one fact made it impossible for navigation to feel efficient or even fruitful, and increased frustration reduced tolerance for other quirks of the system. We also both experienced the difficulty of the broken "Search" page. In the end, I had to intervene to let my tester know that the search function on the "Browse" page was operational, as he was becoming irritated and inclined to cease working on the task altogether. A nonfunctional search function is, indeed, a massive roadblock.
  </p>
  <p>
  My tester encountered fewer instances where filters rather than nested pages would have created a better user experience, but discovered problems with the sort features that I did not. He attempted to sort by date and quickly realized that the function does not work. Not only does it not sort resources chronologically, though their dates of publication are listed in the item names, but it does not even group resources created in the same year together. He also realized that it is strikingly difficult to find the newspaper archives, which seem like they should be central to the archive. As he was investigating a more specific topic than I was, he realized that the fact that the information is fairly organized did not mean that it is easy to retrieve what he was looking for.
  </p>
  <p>
  To improve the site, first and foremost, pages must load faster. If that is logistically impossible, then a loading feature should be integrated so that users are kept apprised of the state of their queries and actions. on an equally basic level, the Search page needs to be fixed. It is unreasonable to expect that a user unfamiliar with the system would be able to identify that the Browse "search" function does, in fact, work. Similarly, all sort functions need to work or be removed, though removal would result in a far less functional system than repair. On a slightly more complicated level, site designers should assess what categories would be useful filters and what should be pages that must be navigated in order to get to information. To put it briefly, there should be fewer steps to get to resources, and it should be a quick and easy process to get from the Browse or Search pages to the resources themselves.
