<h1 style="text-align:center;">Project Gutenberg Reviewed</h1>
<h2>What is Project Gutenberg?</h2>
<p> <a href:"https://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a> is a free online eBook database. Since 1970, their goal has been to put out-of-copyright books into the hands, or onto the screens, of readers. They are the first free eBook provider, and are currently supported by about 10,000 volunteers annually. They also seek to preserve texts for posterity, hoping that by putting them online in a variety of formats they will ensure that, no matter what technological changes come, the words will always live on.

Because Project Gutenberg only takes books that are out of copyright, and because they are powered entirely by volunteer transcribers, their books tend to fit into the following categories:
<ul>
<li> Over 95 years old
<li>English-language
<li>Classics
<li>Somewhat well-known
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Who is Project Gutenberg for?</h2>
<p>In theory, Project Gutenberg is for anyone who can read and who has an Internet connection. Use of the site is free and does not require a login or membership, which makes it very accessible. In practice, their user base is primarily English-speaking and US-based, since they deal only with US copyright law, which restricts their content.
</p>
<h2>What does Project Gutenberg provide?</h2>
<p> Project Gutenberg provides eBooks in a myriad of different formats to suit different reader needs and preferences. They have a smaller collection of audiobooks, though it is no longer being updated, as other repositories have sprung up which are better able to fill that niche. It also has an offline catalog. The eBooks they provide are hand-transcribed by volunteers, then cross-checked, also by volunteers, to ensure accuracy.

Users can employ different filters, including popularity, genre, and date added, to browse the site for their next read. Of course, they can also search by author and title, if they are in search of a particular text. </p>

<h1>Systems Discussion of Project Gutenberg</h1>
<p> The most interesting feature of Project Gutenberg’s site is that they provide the full contents every book they feature in plain text, whatever other formats they may also include. This focus on posterity is commendable, and demonstrates not only their pragmatism, but also their sincere commitment to their mission.

<h2>Suggestions</h2>
<p>Project Gutenberg would benefit from an updated user interface. While mostly functional, it looks and feels dated and a bit clunky. Many of the navigation tools are far smaller than they should be, which makes them difficult to use despite the fact that they are the most useful part of the site.  The search bar should be distinct from other functions and always visible on the screen, as well as larger, since searching for books is the primary use case. To further enhance the browsing functionality, they might add an option for users to review books they’ve read, and provide that user-generated review as another way to sort the catalog.
